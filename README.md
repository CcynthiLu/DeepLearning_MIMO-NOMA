# DeepLearning_MIMO-NOMA



> hi, guys. I`m Jeongwoo Do in PNU EE

> Python file `MIMO_NOMA_DNN` is realization of MIMO_NOMA signal detection system based on
> **C. Lin et al., “A deep learning approach for MIMO-NOMA downlink signal detection,” MDPI Sensors, vol. 19, no. 11, pp. 2526, 2019. **'''

> Python file `MIMO_NOMA_DLL_ML` is performance comparison between DNN based MIMO-NOMA signal detection and ML ,best performance in terms of a BER
